# [Ongoing] Coffee's Brew
A potion-brewing and cooking RPG made in Unity where you manage a coffee shop and brew magical potions to battle monsters. Currently, you can craft and and cook a variety of baked goods, and customize the interior of your shop with a variety of furniture and appliances.
# What I've Learned
* Expandable building and interaction systems using object-oriented design (classes, inheritance, interfaces, Unity's scriptable objects)
* Created pixel art assets and animations using Aseprite
